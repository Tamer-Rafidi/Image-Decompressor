# 🖼️ Image Decompressor

Image Decompressor is a hardware-based project implemented in Verilog to perform lossless decoding, dequantization, inverse signal transformation, interpolation, and color space conversion. The system runs on FPGA hardware, using Quartus for simulation, timing analysis, and deployment, and is capable of reconstructing compressed images in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Upsampling & Colour Space Conversion (M1)**                         
  Converts YUV to RGB using interpolation and color space conversion with ~76% multiplier utilization.
  
- 🔄 **Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (M2)**             
  Implements IDCT with multiple DPRAMs to fetch, multiply, and store coefficients, reconstructing image data from frequency space to pixel space.
  
- 🗂️ **Lossless Decoding & Dequantization**               
  Supports reverse-engineering of compressed image data into raw pixel values.
  
- 💾 **SRAM & DPRAM Integration**          
  Efficient read/write operations to handle pixel blocks for real-time decompression.        
- ⚙️ **Modular FSM Design**             
  Each stage (Fs, Ct, Cs, Ws) runs as an independent state machine for parallelism and clarity.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Milestone 1 (Colour Space + Upsampling):**
  - ~273,600 clock cycles to complete per image row set.
  - Achieved ~75% multiplier utilization.
  - 1267 logic elements used.
- **Milestone 2 (IDCT):**
  - ~1,257,600 total clock cycles to complete for Y, U, and V segments.
  - 2101 additional logic elements, bringing total usage to ~3698 (as estimated by Quartus).
- **Overall:**
  - ~3.4x increase in resource utilization from baseline, demonstrating the cost of IDCT operations in hardware.

## 🧰Future Improvements
