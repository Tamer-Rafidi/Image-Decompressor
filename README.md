# Image-Decompressor

Developed a hardware-based image decompressor in Verilog, adhering to the .mic18 specification to reconstruct 320x240 pixel images. Implemented lossless decoding, dequantization, and 8x8 IDCT using fixed-point arithmetic for efficiency. Optimized YUV to RGB conversion with symmetric interpolation, reducing computational complexity. Integrated the design with an Altera DE2-115 FPGA for efficient image reconstruction.
